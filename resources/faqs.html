      <h2>What is student wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Student wellbeing encompasses physical, mental, emotional, and social aspects. According to the Oxford International Curriculum, it involves taking care of the body, mind, relationships, and finding meaning or purpose in the world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Why measure wellbeing in schools?</h2>
      <p>Measuring wellbeing helps educators understand students' feelings and identify areas for improvement. This information can guide targeted interventions, promoting higher levels of wellbeing, which are positively correlated with academic achievements and other educational outcomes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How to measure wellbeing in schools?</h2>
      <p>Wellbeing can be assessed through observations, interviews, focus groups, and surveys or questionnaires. Each method has strengths and limitations; combining approaches can provide a comprehensive understanding of student wellbeing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What are the benefits of using surveys to measure student wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Surveys offer a quick and efficient way to gather information on student wellbeing, helping identify areas for improvement and informing intervention decisions. They provide a standardized approach that allows comparisons across different schools or time periods.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What are the limitations of using surveys?</h2>
      <p>Surveys may not capture the full complexity of student wellbeing and can be influenced by factors like participant honesty and individual perceptions. They reflect wellbeing at a specific point in time, while wellbeing is dynamic. Additionally, implementing surveys can be resource-intensive for schools.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What questions are asked in a student wellbeing survey?</h2>
      <p>Surveys may include questions about social and emotional wellbeing, such as feelings about school, friendships, support systems, and safety. They may also address physical wellbeing topics like sleep, diet, exercise, and screen time. Questions can vary based on student age.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>What types of wellbeing interventions are the most effective?</h2>
      <p>Effective interventions often focus on enhancing belonging, engagement, social-emotional skills, and physical activity. Programs delivered by trained teachers, tailored to social groups, and lasting longer than three months tend to be more impactful. Interventions should be tailored to the specific needs of the school community.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How does Schoolmait approach the challenge of measuring wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Schoolmait provides a holistic assessment of student wellbeing by gathering inputs from students, parents, and teachers. It offers detailed analysis for each student, prioritizes privacy by using aliases, and reduces staff burden by streamlining questionnaire development, data collection, and report preparation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Which wellbeing elements are being measured?</h2>
      <p>Schoolmait measures the following elements: Meaning & Purpose, Emotion Management, Digital Wellbeing, Student-Teacher Relations, Safety & Belonging, Resilience, Physical Wellbeing, and Peer Relations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How is the wellbeing score calculated?</h2>
      <p>Questionnaires use multiple-choice questions with a Likert scale, scoring each response between -2 and +2. Average scores are calculated for each wellbeing element and perspective (student, parent, teacher), allowing for individual and group-level analysis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>Is wellbeing measurement considered a clinical assessment of mental disorders?</h2>
      <p>No, wellbeing measurement is not a clinical assessment. It serves as a tool for early detection of mild symptoms, enabling timely interventions before issues escalate into more serious conditions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h2>How can schools use the results of the surveys to promote wellbeing?</h2>
      <p>Schools can use survey results to identify areas where students are struggling and develop targeted interventions. They can also track progress over time and assess the effectiveness of these interventions.</p>
